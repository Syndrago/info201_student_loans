# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

## Domain of Interest:

We are interested in looking at student loan data and projects because this domain is something that members in our group can all relate to and we are interested in seeing the demographics of student loan data. 

## Data Driven Project Examples:
- https://ticas.org/interactive-map/
- https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2020/11/16/what-is-the-current-student-debt-situation/
- https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loan-debt

## Data Driven Questions:
- Who is taking out student loans (based on location, economic status, age, gender, etc.)?
- What are the quantities involved (average loan amount, total loans taken out)?
- Can Biden really forgive all or even part of the Federal Student Loan?
